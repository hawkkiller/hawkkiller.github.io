My name is `Michael Lazebny` and I'm 16 y.o. Currently, I live in Cracow, Poland. I'm passionate about programming and I'm always looking for new challenges. Now, I am working as a __Flutter Developer__, but I'm also interested in other fields. I'm also a big fan of open-source and I always try to contribute to the community. `Not currently looking for a job, but I'm always open to new opportunities.`
